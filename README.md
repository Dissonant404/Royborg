A discord.py bot made by me. It is the first public discord bot I made. It has moderation commands, utilities, fun stuff and minigames and other random interesting things. I have also added a chatbot specifically for my own friends' server. If you wish to integrate it in your bot, refer to [this github](https://github.com/codewithswastik/prsaw). If there are any bugs or improvement which you wish to suggest, feel free to add me on discord ðŸ˜€ (Starlight#6969). 

BTW, Here is the bot's [invite link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=859809701298569227&permissions=8&scope=bot) ðŸ˜Š

Peace âœŒ
